    "ground_truth": "Structural Solutions for Pooja Room Correction: When existing pooja rooms are incorrectly positioned, immediate relocation to the northeast corner provides the most effective remedy for restoring spiritual harmony and positive energy flow. If complete relocation is not feasible, reorienting idols to face west while ensuring devotees face east during prayers can significantly improve energy alignment. Constructing raised platforms within incorrectly placed pooja rooms helps elevate the sacred space above negative ground energies.",
